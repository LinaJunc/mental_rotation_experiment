The mental rotation experiment is Lina Junctorius' first experiment using _babe.

The homework was to change the departure point experiment to a key press task. The participants has to decide if two objects which have different locations in space are identical or not. Therefore they have to press 'f' meaning the objects are the same or 'j' meaning they are different.
In the final output you can also see the number of the picture, the degree of rotation and if the objects were actually same or different.
